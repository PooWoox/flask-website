# flask-website

This is a blog kind of website created with Flask features on Python. It is still in progress and as soon as it has interactive features like posts and logins working I'll post here everything it has and future implementations.

For running it make sure you download all the files and run the file "run.py" to execute everything that is on the "website" package and access on your localhost:5000

Thank you for viewing this project executed by me, as always I'm open to receiving any suggestions on how to improve my code and other helping comments. Here to learn.
